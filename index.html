      Originally from Georgia, I'm a 24 yrs old and am an aspiring Software
      Developer. Lover of dogs, food enthusiast, human and civil rights
      advocate. I've always been the tech savvy person of the family. I would
      always wander off and play with the cool gadgets and computers on display
      at Best Buy. My mom noticed this and said I should go into the technology
      field. Naturally of course, I went against what my mother suggested and
      pursued an education in health sciences. It wasn't until I graduated
      college, that I began questioning if I was on the right career path. I
      wanted something different and a new way to challenge myself. The Road to
      Hire program was brought to my attention and I jumped at the chance to
      create a new life for myself. Learning skills and languages I'd never
      thought possible, I found a new passion for technology and learning.
      Everyday I continue to learn and grow more confident in my skills and plan
      to complete other certifications, such as AWS. My primary goal for my
      career is to create a welcoming, easily accessible, and efficient
      experience not only for the client, but for my team as well. Eventually, I
      would love to use my work ethic, leadership and desire to cultivate
      community to work towards a position in management. I am confident in my
      capability to achieve this.
